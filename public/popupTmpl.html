<u>Normal Search Mode</u>
<p>The normal search mode will allow users to search by both URL's and keywords. It will return all results 
that contain the search term.
<p>For example searching for the term 'Undergraduate' will return results like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>http://www.uel.ac.uk/Undergraduate/Art-and-Design</li>
	<li>http://www.uel.ac.uk/Undergraduate/Mechanical-Engineering</li>
	<li>http://www.uel.ac.uk/Undergraduate/Mechanical-Engineering</li>
</ul>

<u>Exact Match Search Mode</u>
<p>The 'exact match' search mode will allow the user to search by an exact URL. Only exact matches will be 
returned in this mode.</p>
<p>For example searching for <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.uel.ac.uk/Undergraduate/Art-and-Design</span> will return only the Page url results that match that url exactly.</p>

<u>Show Entries Field </u>
<p>This should be used to control the number of results that are loaded onto the page at one time.</p>
<p class="emphasise">*Please note that setting this to a significantly high number may cause performance issues.</p>

<u>Load More Results Link</u>
<p>The 'Load More Results' link can be used to load more results onto the page. The amount of results that are loaded
is determined by the number set in the 'show entries' field.</p>
<p>Clicking the 'load more' link repeatedly will load the data in increments of the number specified in the 
'show entries' field. The data will continue to be appended to the end of the page until the total number of results are showing on the page. </p>
<p>This method of displaying search results has been implemented to allow the browser to handle hundreds 
of thousands or even millions of results without resulting in performance/termination issues.</p>

<u>Download to CSV</u>
<p>This link will allow the user to download the entirety of the search results to a csv file, which can be viewed in a Spreadsheet.</p>
